This project is a clean and practical implementation of a **cubic Bézier surface with extrusion**, combining Bézier curve computation with 3D directional modeling. The project reads control points and parameters 
from a file and computes surface points dynamically based on user input. It’s a great example of bringing mathematical concepts into interactive software design.
